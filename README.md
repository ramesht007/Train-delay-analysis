# Train-delay-analysis
## Abstract

<div align="center">Despite the fact that punctuality is an advantage of rail travel compared with other long-distance transport, train delays often occur. For this study,
a dataset of weather, train delay and train schedule records were collected and analyzed in order to understand the patterns of train 
delays and to predict train delay time. We found that in severe weather train delays are determined mainly by the type of bad weather, 
while in ordinary weather the delays are determined mainly by the historical delay time and delay frequency of trains. Identifying the factors 
closely correlated with train delays, we developed a machine-learning model to predict the delay time of each train at each station. The proposed prediction 
model is useful not only for passengers wishing to plan their journeys more reliably, but also for railway operators developing more efficient train schedules 
and more reasonable pricing plans.</div>

## Scope and objectives

- To develop a methadology that can predict train delays.
- To select an appropriate Platform for implementing the code.
- Perform the exploratory analysis on the train delay data.
